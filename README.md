# blink1-tool morse code wrapper
This is a small python script that wraps around the blink1-tool for the command line. It translates the command line input text into [morse code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) and emits them through the blink1. 

## Setup
* Make sure you have [downloaded the right version of the blink1-tool](http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html) for your OS. 
* Set the BLINK_TOOL_PATH in morse.py to the full path to your blink1-tool
* That should be it! 

## Examples
Here are two short clips showing it in action:

## Gosh, this code is ugly!
Yup, it is. It's a quick hack with some features added as an afterthought. But it seems to work. If you want to rewrite it or make it less ugly: Go for it!
